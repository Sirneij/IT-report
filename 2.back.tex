\section{History and Corporate Profile}
\subsection{History}
With its headquarters at 4, Balarabe Musa
Crescent, Victoria Island, Lagos and several branch offices in Lagos, Ibadan, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt, ipNX Nigeria Limited is a leading
provider of infrastructure-based telecommunication and information technological services based
here in Nigeria. With more than a decade of experience, the company was formed by the
divestment of the telecommunications services division of Telnet Nigeria Limited and has been in
operations for over fifteen (15) years.
ipNX Nigeria Limited started as a business division of Telnet Nigeria Limited - the leading
indigenous Telecommunication and Information Technology Services Company in Nigeria. Telnet
started business in 1987 as telecommunications engineering company and grew into other areas of
information technology as technology evolved and opportunities arose. A major part of the
business of telnet was providing data communication services, mainly wide area networks to
Corporate communities in Nigeria in the Oil and Gas as well as Financial Services industries. Since
NITEL was the monopoly provider of telecommunication services in Nigeria due to government
regulation, these networks had to be built with NITEL facilities.
In December 1992, the Federal Government of Nigeria deregulated the
telecommunications industry, thereby opening it up to competition and other organizations were
allowed to provide telecommunications services. Telnet saw this as an opportunity to improve its
services to its customers and started to build its own communications network using radio and
VSAT (satellite) technologies.
The radio networks are utilized for communications between locations in the same
metropolitan area while VSAT networks were mainly used to provide long distance communications. The corporate organizations used the networks provided for both private voice and data communications.\\

In 2001 Telnet decided to separate the infrastructure based business from the engineering
(or knowledge) based business. This was done to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item To allow Telnet Nigeria Limited provide engineering services to other infrastructure
	based service providers who might see Telnet as a competition.
	\item To allow other investors to invest in the infrastructure based business, which is very
	capital intensive.
\end{itemize}

The infrastructure based Services Company within Telnet was therefore detached from the group to form a new company – “Netco Services Limited”. Some of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) licenses with Telnet were transferred to Netco and
Netco obtained some additional licenses from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). In total Netco has:
\begin{itemize}	
	\item Regional 3.5GHz FWA (Fixed Wireless Access) licenses in Lagos, Cross River, Bayelsa
	and Abuja.
	\item National VSAT license.
	\item Internet Service Provider License.
\end{itemize}

Unfortunately, a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC); the National Engineering and Technical Company had also been known in the Nigerian environment with the acronym Netco and this caused a bit of confusion in the market
place, hence in April 2003 the name of the company was changed to ipNX Nigeria Limited.\\

ipNX has now obtained additional frequencies from the NCC to be used to provide consumer and small businesses with Internet and Data Communications. These have been allocated to Lagos, Abuja (FCT), Cross Rivers and Bayelsa States with an opportunity to go to other states in Nigeria after we have started providing services in these locations.
